# Font Security System

This document outlines the comprehensive font security system implemented to protect your commercial font files from unauthorized access.

## 🔒 Security Features

### 1. **AES-256 Encryption**
- All font files are encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption
- Each font has a unique encryption key derived from the master key + font identifiers
- Files are stored with random initialization vectors (IVs) for additional security

### 2. **Obfuscated Storage**
- Encrypted files are stored with obfuscated filenames
- Original file paths are replaced with secure references in the database
- Files are stored outside the public web directory

### 3. **Token-Based Access Control**
- Download tokens are generated for each authorized download
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (50 downloads per hour per user)

### 4. **Audit Logging**
- All font downloads are logged with user, IP, and timestamp
- Failed access attempts are tracked
- Comprehensive audit trail for security monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Encryption
```bash
# Generate encryption key and setup environment
node scripts/setup-encryption.js setup

# Restart your development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Encrypt Existing Fonts
```bash
# Encrypt all public font files
node scripts/encrypt-fonts.js encrypt

# Verify encryption worked
node scripts/encrypt-fonts.js verify

# Remove public fonts (optional, after verification)
node scripts/encrypt-fonts.js encrypt --remove-public
```

### 3. Test Secure Downloads
Your existing download system will automatically handle encrypted fonts. Users with valid licenses can download fonts through the secure API.

## 📁 Directory Structure

## 🔐 How It Works

### Encryption Process
1. **Key Generation**: Unique key derived from master key + font ID + style ID
2. **File Encryption**: AES-256-CBC encryption with random IV
3. **Obfuscation**: Encrypted file stored with hash-based filename
4. **Database Update**: File path updated to `secure:filename.encrypted`

### Download Process
1. **License Verification**: User must have valid, active license
2. **Token Generation**: Secure download token created (24hr expiry)
3. **File Decryption**: Font decrypted on-demand during download
4. **Secure Delivery**: File served with security headers, no caching

## 🛡️ Security Levels

### Current Implementation (Good)
- ✅ AES-256 encryption
- ✅ Obfuscated filenames
- ✅ Token-based access
- ✅ License verification
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Rate limiting

### Enhanced Security (Better)
```javascript
// Additional security measures you can implement:

// 1. IP-based restrictions
const allowedIPs = ['192.168.1.0/24'];

// 2. Geographic restrictions
const allowedCountries = ['US', 'CA', 'GB'];

// 3. Device fingerprinting
const deviceFingerprint = generateFingerprint(request);

// 4. Time-based restrictions
const businessHours = isBusinessHours(new Date());
```

### Enterprise Security (Best)
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Advanced threat detection
- Custom DRM integration
- Blockchain-based licensing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
FONT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-hex-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-key

# Optional
FONT_MAX_DOWNLOADS_PER_HOUR=50
FONT_TOKEN_EXPIRY_HOURS=24
FONT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_DAYS=30
```

### Database Schema
The system uses these tables:
- `font_families` - Font family information
- `font_styles` - Font style data with encrypted file paths
- `user_licenses` - User licensing information
- `font_downloads` - Download tokens and audit logs
- `audit_log` - Comprehensive security audit trail

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
```bash
# Verify font integrity
node scripts/encrypt-fonts.js verify

# Clean up expired files
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/secure-fonts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "cleanup_expired"}'

# Check audit logs
# Review font_downloads and audit_log tables in Supabase
```

### Security Monitoring
Monitor these metrics:
- Failed download attempts
- Unusual download patterns
- Token generation rates
- File integrity checks
- Geographic access patterns

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### What This Protects Against
- ✅ Direct file access via URL guessing
- ✅ Unauthorized downloads without licenses
- ✅ File sharing between users
- ✅ Bulk downloading attacks
- ✅ Cache-based font theft

### What This Doesn't Protect Against
- ❌ Screen capture of rendered fonts
- ❌ Reverse engineering of font files
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Compromised user accounts
- ❌ Client-side font extraction

### Additional Recommendations
1. **Regular Key Rotation**: Rotate encryption keys periodically
2. **Backup Strategy**: Secure backup of encrypted fonts and keys
3. **Access Reviews**: Regular review of user licenses and access
4. **Incident Response**: Plan for security incident handling
5. **Legal Protection**: Terms of service and licensing agreements

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From Public Fonts to Encrypted
1. **Backup**: Backup your current font files
2. **Setup**: Run encryption setup script
3. **Encrypt**: Encrypt existing fonts
4. **Verify**: Test download functionality
5. **Remove**: Remove public fonts after verification

### Rollback Procedure
If you need to rollback:
1. Keep backups of original public fonts
2. Update database paths back to public paths
3. Restore public font files
4. Update download API to handle public paths

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Encryption Key Not Found**
```bash
# Generate new key
node scripts/setup-encryption.js setup
```

**Font File Not Found**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -la secure-fonts/
# Check database paths
```

**Download Token Expired**
```bash
# Tokens expire after 24 hours - generate new one
# Check font_downloads table for token status
```

**Permission Denied**
```bash
# Check file permissions
chmod 644 secure-fonts/*
# Verify directory permissions
chmod 755 secure-fonts/
```
